# Inspire Confidence Export

This directory contains classes to export data from Inspire Confidence
into a format suitable for import into the training Docker, which is based
on Brightspot GO.

Although it is set up to build with Gradle, that is not the intended usage;
it merely enables more convenience when working with the files in an IDE.
Instead, you should copy the files into an existing Brightspot repo and run
them as part of that larger ecosystem. Use the [run.sh](run.sh) script to
conduct this process automatically.
