# Testing in Docker

To test the feature end-to-end, you’ll need to publish some data in the CMS. First publish the following Recipes (use Recipe, not Recipe Article). You’ll find the data and images you need here (apologies if this makes you hungry!). Make sure you are in the Inspire Confidence site before you start publishing.
- [Arugula Stuffed Pork Tenderloin](test-content/arugula-stuffed-pork-tenderloin.html)
- [Asparagus with Balsamic Vinaigrette](test-content/asparagus-with-balsamic-vinaigrette.html)
- [French Onion Soup](test-content/french-onion-soup.html)
- [Gougeres with Cheese and Scallions](test-content/gougeres-with-cheese-and-scallions.html)
- [Mushroom Goat Cheese Tarte](test-content/mushroom-goat-cheese-tarte.html)
- [Roasted Beet and Onion Salad](test-content/roasted-beet-and-onion-salad.html)
- [Small Flourless Rum Chocolate Cake](test-content/flourless-rum-chocolate-cake.html)

Then publish a new Meal using the data found [here](test-content/meal.html). After all that is published you should be able to see the full page on the frontend ([see this screenshot]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/meal-exercise-test-content/meal-full-screenshot.png) for comparison purposes). Congratulations on your achievement!
