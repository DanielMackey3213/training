# Meal Exercise

This exercise builds on the Recipe exercise covered in the Brightspot Backend Training presentation. Start your work by branching off of the [`exercise/recipe branch`](https://github.com/perfectsense/training/tree/exercise/recipe), or, if youâ€™ve done the Recipe exercise on your own, you can use that as a starting point; you need to have completed up through the Modification exercise (the GraphQL work is not needed for this exercise).

The finished exercise is in this branch for you to compare your work with: <https://github.com/perfectsense/training/tree/exercise/meal>

## Prerequisites

Ensure you've followed the setup instructions in the [training repo readme](https://github.com/perfectsense/training#brightspot-training). The readme also lists commands for building and running the project.
