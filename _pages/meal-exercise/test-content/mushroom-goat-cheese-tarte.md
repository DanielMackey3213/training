## Title
Mushroom Goat Cheese Tarte

## Difficulty
Intermediate

## Ingredients
- 6 ounces goat cheese
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ teaspoon heaping thyme leaves chopped
- salt and pepper
- 10 ounces mushrooms, cleaned and stem cut off at cap base, finely sliced
- 2 shallots, finely sliced
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 tablespoons brandy
- fresh thyme optional
- 1 sheet puff pastry
- 1 egg beaten with a teaspoon water

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 400F.
2. Mix goat cheese with honey, olive oil, thyme chopped leaves, salt, and pepper until creamy and spreadable. Set aside.
3. In a large skillet add the 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and mushrooms. Sauté until all liquid has evaporated and the mushrooms starting to turn golden at the edges, 5 minutes. Add the brandy and cook until evaporated, less than 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
4. Defrost the puff pastry and roll it out on a floured surface until it is half the thickness that you started with. With a sharp knife cut 1 inch off from each side. With a small baking brush, brush the egg mixture at the outer edges of the pastry. Place the 1-inch strip of puff pastry over it to form a riser border. The outer edges must be aligned one on top of the other properly.
5. Place the puff pastry over a silpat or parchment paper in a cookie sheet. Spread the goat cheese inside the puff pastry and top with the mushrooms. Spread some of the egg wash over the puff pastry border.
6. Bake in the warm oven for 20 minutes. Let it rest for a couple of minutes and serve.
