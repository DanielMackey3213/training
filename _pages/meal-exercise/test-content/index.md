# Test Content

Here are some recipes as well as a meal which you can publish in your CMS so you can test your work. We recommend publishing everything fully so you get some experience working in the CMS and thinking like an editor. As developers it's easy to forget that we are building something for editors—who will probably use it for several hours every day—so it's important to keep the editorial experience in mind as you work.
