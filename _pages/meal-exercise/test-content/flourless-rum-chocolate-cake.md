## Title
Small Flourless Rum Chocolate Cake

## Difficulty
Intermediate

## Ingredients
- 6 ounces dark chocolate, coarsely chopped
- ½ cup butter, cubed
- ½ cup demerara sugar
- 5 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- ½ cup cocoa powder
- ⅓ cup dark or light rum
- Chocolate- rum glaze
- 4 ounces dark chocolate, coarsely chopped
- 3 tbs butter
- 1 tbs rum
- ½ tsp vanilla extract


## Directions
1. Melt together chocolate and butter over low heat, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat and transfer to a mixing bowl.
2. Add sugar, mix for 1 -2 minutes until melted.
3. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing until smooth between each addition.
4. Stir in the vanilla extract, cocoa powder, and rum until well mixed.
5. Pour batter into the greased 8-inch baking pan and bake for 25-30 minutes at 190°C, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out relatively clean with a few crumbs. Do not over-bake or the cake will become dry. Allow cake to cool in pan for 5 minutes before inverting onto a serving plate.
6. Meanwhile, prepare the glaze: in a small saucepan, melt together chocolate and butter, mixing until smooth.
7. Stir in the rum and vanilla extract.
8. Spread evenly over cooled cake.
